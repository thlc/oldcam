OldCam -- bringing metadata to the film age.

OldCam is meant to help film photographers to store technical details about
their shots, just like digital cameras store EXIF metadata in files.

For each shot, you can store the date, the aperture, the shutter speed, and
notes.

The database can be exported as a CSV to allow an easy processing afterwards.
